"""Blueprint stress tests for downstream repositories.

This module contains example stress tests covering concurrent operations,
data processing, and file I/O under load. These are **placeholder tests
you should replace** with stress tests for your own system.

The Rhiza project's own stress tests live in ``.rhiza/tests/stress/``.
