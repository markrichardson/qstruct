## 🌟 Why Rhiza?

**Unlike traditional project templates** (like cookiecutter or copier) that generate a one-time snapshot of configuration files, **Rhiza provides living templates** that evolve with your project. Classic templates help you start a project, but once generated, your configuration drifts away from the template as best practices change. Rhiza takes a different approach: it enables **continuous synchronization**, allowing you to selectively pull template updates into your project over time through automated workflows. This means you can benefit from improvements to CI/CD workflows, linting rules, and development tooling without manually tracking upstream changes. Think of it as keeping your project's foundation fresh and aligned with modern practices, while maintaining full control over what gets updated.

### Rhiza and rhiza-cli

Rhiza has two distinct components:

- **[rhiza](https://github.com/jebel-quant/rhiza)** (this repository) — the *template content*: the curated set of configuration files, Makefile modules, CI/CD workflows, and tooling files that downstream projects sync from.
- **[rhiza-cli](https://pypi.org/project/rhiza-cli/)** — the *CLI engine*: a separate Python package (installed on-the-fly via `uvx`) that provides the `rhiza` command and implements operations such as `init`, `sync`, `bump`, and `release`.

In short: **rhiza** is the *what* (the template files you receive); **rhiza-cli** is the *how* (the tool that fetches and applies them).

When you run `uvx rhiza init` or `uvx rhiza sync`, you are invoking the `rhiza-cli` package — it reads your `.rhiza/template.yml` and syncs the matching files from this repository (or your own fork) into your project. The two components are versioned independently, so templates and the CLI can be updated separately.

### How It Works

Rhiza uses a simple configuration file (`.rhiza/template.yml`) to control which templates sync to your project. The recommended approach is to select **template bundles** by name — pre-configured sets of related files grouped by feature:

```yaml
# .rhiza/template.yml
repository: Jebel-Quant/rhiza
ref: v0.7.1

templates:
  - core
  - tests
  - github
  - docker
```

**What you're seeing:**
- **`repository`** - The upstream template source (**can be any repository, not just Rhiza!**)
- **`ref`** - Which version tag/branch to sync from (e.g., `v0.7.1` or `main`)
- **`templates`** - Template bundles to include by name (see [Available Template Bundles](#-available-template-bundles) below)

For advanced use cases you can still use explicit `include`/`exclude` file patterns alongside or instead of bundles:

```yaml
# Advanced: file-pattern based selection
include: |
  .github/workflows/*.yml
  ruff.toml

exclude: |
  .rhiza/scripts/customisations/*
```

> **💡 Automated Updates:** When using a version tag (e.g., `v0.7.1`) instead of a branch name, Renovate will automatically create pull requests to update the `ref` field when new versions are released. This keeps your templates up-to-date with minimal manual intervention. 
>
> To enable this in your project, copy the [`regexManagers` configuration](renovate.json#L31-L40) from this repository's `renovate.json` file into your own Renovate configuration. See the linked configuration for the complete setup.

When you run `uvx rhiza sync` or trigger the automated sync workflow, Rhiza fetches only the files matching your `include` patterns, skips anything in `exclude`, and creates a clean diff for you to review. You stay in control of what updates and when.

**💡 Pro Tip:** While you can use `Jebel-Quant/rhiza` directly, **we recommend creating your own template repository** using GitHub's "Use this template" button. This gives you a clean copy to customise for your organisation's specific needs and constraints—adjusting CI workflows, coding standards, or tooling choices—while still benefiting from Rhiza's sync mechanism. Your template repo becomes your team's source of truth, and you can selectively pull updates from upstream Rhiza when desired.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** - Ensure your project supports Python 3.11 or newer
- **Git** - Your project should be a Git repository
- **Backup** - Consider committing any uncommitted changes before integration

### Automated Integration (Recommended)

The fastest way to integrate Rhiza:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialise configuration templates
uvx rhiza init

# Edit .rhiza/template.yml to select desired templates
# Then sync the templates
uvx rhiza sync
```

**Options:**

```

```result
Hello, World!
2
3.14
0.71
```

### Documentation Customisation

For information on customising the look and feel of your documentation, see [book/README.md](book/README.md).

### Python Version Management

The `.python-version` file specifies the default Python version for local development. Tools like `uv` and `pyenv` automatically use this version. Simply update this file to change your local Python version.

### Makefile Customisation

Rhiza uses a modular Makefile system with extension points (hooks) for customisation. See [.rhiza/make.d/README.md](.rhiza/make.d/README.md) for the complete guide including:
- Extension points and hooks
- Custom target creation
- Module ordering conventions

### Custom Build Scripts

For system dependencies and custom build steps, see [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).

### Private GitHub Packages

Rhiza's template workflows automatically support private GitHub packages from the same organization. Simply add them to your `pyproject.toml`:

**In `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
my-package = { git = "https://github.com/jebel-quant/my-package.git", rev = "v1.0.0" }
```

**Git authentication is already configured** in all Rhiza workflows (CI, book, release, etc.) using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which automatically provides read access to repositories in the same organization.

For custom workflows or local development setup, see [.rhiza/docs/PRIVATE_PACKAGES.md](.rhiza/docs/PRIVATE_PACKAGES.md).

### Release Management

For information on versioning, tagging, and publishing releases, see [.rhiza/docs/RELEASING.md](.rhiza/docs/RELEASING.md).

### Dev Container

This repository includes a template Dev Container configuration for seamless development in VS Code and GitHub Codespaces. See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for setup, configuration, and troubleshooting.

For details about the VS Code extensions configured in the Dev Container, see [docs/VSCODE_EXTENSIONS.md](docs/VSCODE_EXTENSIONS.md).
